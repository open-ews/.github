**OpenEWS** is the world’s first **open-source Early Warning System (EWS) dissemination dashboard**, designed to help governments, NGOs, and communities deliver life-saving alerts to vulnerable populations before disaster strikes.

Developed and maintained by Chatterbox Solutions, the creators of [Somleng](https://github.com/somleng), OpenEWS is part of our mission to create scalable, cost-effective, and locally adaptable technology for disaster response and preparedness.

## 🚨 What is OpenEWS?

* Register and manage **millions of beneficiaries**
* Send **targeted alerts** via SMS, voice, or other communication channels
* Integrate with national telecoms and mobile network operators (MNOs)
* Visualize and audit alert delivery
* Maintain full control over data and system infrastructure

> ⚠️ OpenEWS is currently in active development. Contributions, feedback, and partnerships are welcome.
